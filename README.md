This is the backend of the mobile applicaton MapSuite(Work in progress). It is built using Django rest using postgres. The backend will be deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, while also making use of AWS RDS, AWS S3 and potentially AWS Codedeploy

Feel free to have a look around and suggest changes that would help me improve
